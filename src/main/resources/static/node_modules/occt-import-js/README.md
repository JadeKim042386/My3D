# occt-import-js

The [emscripten](https://emscripten.org) interface for [OpenCascade](https://www.opencascade.com) import functionalities. It runs entirely in the browser, and allows you to import brep, step and iges files and access the result in JSON format.

## How to install?

You can get occt-import-js from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/occt-import-js):

```
npm install occt-import-js
```

## How to use?

The library runs in the browser and as a node.js module as well.

You will need two files from the `dist` folder: `occt-import-js.js` and `occt-import-js.wasm`. The wasm file is loaded runtime by the js file. There are three public functions in the library:

- `ReadBrepFile` to import brep file.
- `ReadStepFile` to import step file.
- `ReadIgesFile` to import iges file.

All functions have two parameters:

- `content`: The file content as a `Uint8Array` object.
- `params`: Triangulation parameters as an object, can be `null`.
  - If the value is `null`, the triangulation density is calculated automatically based on the bounding boxes of elements.
  - If the value is not `null`, the object can have two number values, `linearDeflection` and `angularDeflection`. You can find more information about these values [here](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_user_guides__mesh.html).

### Use from the browser

First, include the `occt-import-js.js` file in your website.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="occt-import-js.js"></script>
```

After that, download the model file, and pass them to occt-import-js.

```js
occtimportjs ().then (async function (occt) {
    let fileUrl = '../test/testfiles/simple-basic-cube/cube.stp';
    let response = await fetch (fileUrl);
    let buffer = await response.arrayBuffer ();
    let fileBuffer = new Uint8Array (buffer);
    let result = occt.ReadStepFile (fileBuffer, null);
    console.log (result);
});
```

### Use as a node.js module

You should require the `occt-import-js` module in your script.

```js
let fs = require ('fs');
const occtimportjs = require ('occt-import-js')();

occtimportjs.then ((occt) => {
    let fileUrl = '../test/testfiles/simple-basic-cube/cube.stp';
    let fileContent = fs.readFileSync (fileUrl);
    let result = occt.ReadStepFile (fileContent, null);
    console.log (result);
});
```

### Processing the result

The result of the import is a JSON object with the following structure.

- **success** (boolean): Tells if the import was successful.
- **root** (object): The root node of the hierarchy.
  - **name** (string): Name of the node.
  - **meshes** (array): Indices of the meshes in the meshes array for this node.
  - **children** (array): Array of child nodes for this node.
- **meshes** (array): Array of mesh objects. The geometry representation is compatible with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).
  - **name** (string): Name of the mesh.
  - **color** (array, optional): Array of r, g, and b values of the mesh color.
  - **brep_faces** (array): Array representing the faces of the source b-rep.
    - **first** (number): The first triangle index of the face.
    - **last** (number): The last triangle index of the face.
    - **color** (array): Array of r, g, and b values of the color or null.
  - **attributes** (object)
    - **position** (object)
      - **array** (array): Array of number triplets defining the vertex positions.
    - **normal** (object, optional)
      - **array** (array): Array of number triplets defining the normal vectors.
  - **index** (object):
    - **array** (array): Array of number triplets defining triangles by indices.

## How to build on Windows?

A set of batch scripts are prepared for building on Windows.

### 1. Install Prerequisites

Install [CMake](https://cmake.org) (3.6 minimum version is needed). Make sure that the cmake executable is in the PATH.

### 2. Install Emscripten SDK

Run the Emscripten setup script.

```
tools\setup_emscripten_win.bat
```

### 3. Compile the WASM library

Run the release build script.

```
tools\build_wasm_win_release.bat
```

### 4. Build the native project (optional)

If you want to debug the code, it's useful to build a native project. To do that, just use cmake to generate the project of your choice.

## How to run locally?

To run the demo and the examples locally, you have to start a web server. Run `npm install` from the root directory, run `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:8080`.
